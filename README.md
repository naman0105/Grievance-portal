# Grievance-portal
This website is made for small size companies. Using this website the employee can complain anonymously. The complain will go to one of the supervisors in an random order, which then will be resolved in a given time period.

The admin module contains functionality to create the hierchy of the organization and to import excel sheets to it to fill the data in the firebase.
The main-website is hosted at :: https://ggrpdebugtest.firebaseapp.com/ or https://naman0105.github.io/Grievance-portal/Main-Website/
The admin-panel is hosted at :: https://naman0105.github.io/Grievance-portal/Main-Website/Admin-Panel

I am using firebase real time database to store the data and firebase otp authentication to authenticate the employee.
